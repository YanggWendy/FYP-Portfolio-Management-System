## Introduction

Machine learning is used for prediction of unknown data, after training our model with training data. It has a great variety of fields of applications, like speech recognition and food classification. Some could even perform predictions better than humans given their ability to process vast amounts of data. With such ability, they have been applied for performing financial predictions in order to trade according to its expected value so as to make money.

However, there is still no golden rule in trading under volatile market conditions and macroeconomic factors, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, Russia-Ukraine War, and high inflation rates. This is because trading strategies perform totally differently under different
market conditions. 

We plan to use four different strategies mainly on stocks and integrate them together to provide a consistent return with risk as low as possible even under volatile market conditions. The four different strategies that we will focus on are: the multi-factor equity model,
NLP-based strategy which analyzes the SEC reports, pairs trading strategy on baskets of stocks using clustering, and rank-based sentiment analysis on the internet. These four strategies will be integrated together using Harry Markowitz's modern portfolio theory in order to minimize the risk. We will also build a platform that traders can use after training the model with combined strategies
